## Conceptual ("About") Help

You can use a conceptual ("about") Help topic to describe the module and its members and to explain how the members can be used together to perform tasks. Conceptual Help topics are text files with Unicode (UTF-8) encoding. The filename must use the about_<name>.help.txt format, such as about_MyModule.help.txt. By default, PowerShell includes over 100 of these conceptual About Help topics, and they're formatted like the following example.
